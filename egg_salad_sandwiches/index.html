			<ol class="steps1">
				<li>Boil water in a pot - put the stove on high</li>
				<li>Add 8-10 eggs</li>
				<li>Keep water at a boil - cook for 12-15 minutes</li>
				<li>Turn off stove - empty water from pot</li>
				<li>Grab a glass cup (tall and skinny works best) and a spoon</li>
				<li>Using the spoon, place one egg at a time in the glass cup and shake it for a few seconds until you
					see cracks in the shell</li>
				<li>Take the egg out of the glass - the shells should easily slide off with minimum effort</li>
				<li>Place shells and unshelled eggs in separate bowls/containers</li>
				<li>Once all the eggs are peeled and placed in a bowl/container, add the mayonnaise and the mustard
					(ratio to the taste of the chef, I prefer a higher mayo to mustard ratio)</li>
				<li>Add any additional ingredients you want, some suggestions are listed at below</li>
				<li>Mash the ingredients together until the eggs are broken up and everything has mixed evenly together
				</li>
				<li>Do a taste test and make any adjustments</li>
				<li>Place in the fridge to cool then ENJOY!! </li>
